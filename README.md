Hi there :wave:

I'm a Canadian :canada: living in Japan :jp:. Currently, I'm working remotely in Fintech.

I like :coffee:, :headphones:, and focus time to get stuff done with Python, Django, JavaScript, Vue, and React.

Some stuff I've made in my free time:

* A custom [Semantic UI admin theme](https://github.com/globophobe/django-semantic-admin) for Django.
* A reuseable Django app to [aggregate candlesticks from high frequency tick data](https://github.com/globophobe/django-quant-candles).

Lightning talks:

* [Gemini 2.5 Pro Doesn't Suck](https://gemini-25-pro-doesnt-suck.netlify.app)
