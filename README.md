Hi there :wave:

I'm a Canadian :canada: living in Japan :jp:. I've been here for about 15 years.

In Canada, I studied Business and Latin American Studies. Because of my interest in Spanish, I spent about 2 years of my life in Mexico. I suppose I like comic art. Actually, I wrote a [paper](https://github.com/globophobe/ruis-and-the-combat-caricaturists/blob/main/Rius_and_the_Combat_Caricaturists.pdf) about it.

These days, I'm interested in Japanese, and about 5 years ago passed JLPT N2. As a result, I can watch anime without subtitles.

Currently I'm in Fintech, and interested in the future of France. I like to GSD with Python, Django, JavaScript, Vue, and React.

Some stuff I've made in my free time:

1. A custom [Semantic UI admin theme](https://github.com/globophobe/django-semantic-admin) for Django.
2. A reuseable Django [app to aggregate candlesticks](https://github.com/globophobe/fastapi-quant-candles) with data from financial exchanges.

My hobby is 3-club speed juggling.
