Hi there :wave:

I'm a Canadian :canada: living in Japan :jp:. Currently, I'm in Fintech, and interested in the future of France.

I like :coffee:, :headphones:, and focus time to GSD with Python, Django, JavaScript, Vue, and React.

Some stuff I've made in my free time:

1. A custom [Semantic UI admin theme](https://github.com/globophobe/django-semantic-admin) for Django.
2. A reuseable Django [app to aggregate candlesticks](https://github.com/globophobe/fastapi-quant-candles) with data from financial exchanges.

My hobby is 3-club speed juggling.
